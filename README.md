# Customized-webpack-react

## overview
This is customized lightweight React webpack for newlearners which include some most necessary dependencies like:- 
* babel-loader
* module-bundler
* css-loader
* react and reactdom

it will help you to add custom based configuration and most important for newlearners who need to create react app from
scratch again and again so to get rid of unnecesssary and bulky node-modules dependencies which we download when we create a new
react app using (**npx create-reactapp**)or (**npm create-reactapp**) then each time whole node module gets downloaded to our syestem
that is around 250mb or more.this is whole webpack for developement in just 50mb.

## what if i want to add more loaders or dependencies ??
well you can add as per your requirements later on it is with just basic setups,you can install any new dependency using
* command npm i **dependency-name** --save -dev
* and making appropriate configuration in webpack.config.js
## To develop a new project 
well! start with cloning this folder to your syestem and without any other configuration
you can start your developement,by making new components and rendering them in **src/App.js** folder.
